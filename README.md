## Overview
Since the beginning of the GWOT campaign, the United States has designated 50 new terrorist organizations which operate in different parts of the world. Despite persistent time and efforts to counter it, terrorism continuously reproduced itself regionally and globally because external forces cannot eradicate the ideology and root causes. Extremist groups have been conducting terrorist activities generation after generation because of what they believe and value. Over 20 years, multiple governments and intergovernmental organizations attempted to combat the global VEO problems. However, such efforts exacerbated the resistance movements and spread worldwide with different sects. Even though the U.S. withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021 and reduced boots on the ground from Iraq, the terrorism hasn't ended. And we don't know where would be the next Caliphate. 
## Questions
The social, economic, and cultural conditions are essential to the individuals belonging to society and form perceptions and moral compasses. Therefore, it is safe to evaluate that the lack of education, especially in unstable countries, does not improve the quality of life, creating vulnerabilities among the younger population. Meanwhile, Extremist groups have been conducting terrorist activities generation after generation because they teach, motivate, and inspire the next generation and continue to propagate what they believe. 
- Does the education level affect participation in violent extremism activities? 
- Does the income level affect participation in violent extremism activities?
### We are trying to answer these questions statistically.
* Null Hypothesis (H0): Lack of education in developing countries has no significant relationship with participation in violent extremist activities.
* Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Lack of education in developing countries significantly relates to participation in violent extremist activities.
## About the data
- The primary dataset for this project is from the START Global Terrorism Database (https://www.start.umd.edu/research-projects/global-terrorism-database-gtd). The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) documents more than 200,000 international and domestic terrorist attacks worldwide since 1970. For this project, I used data from 2001 to 2017 to focus on Global War on Terrorism Campaign era more contemporarily. 
- The second dataset is from the World in Our Data, Section 3, "Years of Schooling" (https://ourworldindata.org/global-education#school-enrollment-and-attendance).
- The third dataset is from the World Bank, and it focuses on the GDP per capita and population by year (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD).
