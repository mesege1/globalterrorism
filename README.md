# globalterrorism

I'm currently building my concept for this project. The current data has so many gaps between countries. For example, Iraq and Afghanistan have had over 20,000 terrorism incidents. Meanwhile, most countries have well under 80 incidents. 

If some countries are experiencing active wars or conflicts, it could lead to inherently higher levels of terrorism activities, which might introduce bias in the analysis. In such cases, performing the analysis on a subset of countries or excluding those with ongoing conflicts to focus on the relationship can be beneficial.

However, it's a dilemma because it may distort the original data.
